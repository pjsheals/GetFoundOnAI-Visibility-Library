# GetFoundOnAI Visibility Library

> **Helping your business get discovered and recommended by ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, and other AI assistants.**

This repository contains LLM-optimized prompts, visibility strategies, scoring frameworks, and semantic injection techniques designed to make your business more visible — and more recommendable — in the new era of AI-driven discovery.

---

## 📌 What This Repo Includes

- **Prompt Libraries** for LLM visibility, semantic targeting, and assistant discovery
- **Injection Strategies** to align your language with LLM output patterns
- **Content Structuring Guidelines** to improve retrieval and recommendation
- **AI Visibility Scoring Frameworks** used to audit and improve prompt performance

## 💡 Why This Matters

Search is changing. More than 50% of product and service discovery now happens inside AI tools — not on Google.

> If ChatGPT doesn’t recommend your business, you’re invisible to a growing audience.

GetFoundOnAI exists to fix that.

We teach you how to:
- 🧠 Appear in relevant LLM-generated responses
- 🧩 Inject visibility prompts into Substack, Medium, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Reddit
- 🔍 Build content structures that AI understands and retrieves
- ⚙️ Optimize for **semantic triggers** not just keywords
